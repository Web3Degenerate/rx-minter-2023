- Per the ThirdWeb **Discord**

`We've received reports from our community that Google Safe Browsing has flagged our IPFS gateway domains (thirdwebstorage.com) as potentially deceptive.`

`We recommend that you update the SDK to the latest version (@thirdweb-dev/sdk@3.10.29, @thirdweb-dev/react@3.14.9) by running npx thirdweb install in your project.`

Run **npx thirdweb install** in your project. (_Note from Devin on 7/10/23_)
